# Alarm_clock

## Overview

The goal in this project report is to give an overall idea of how an alarm clock designed. This design 
consists mainly, microcontroller code, PCB design and enclosure design. It is a great pleasure of 
presenting this project and executing it with the immense interest.
Apart from using the knowledge of electronic, the coding part was included in this project. For stage 1 
evaluation, Arduino C++ was used and for stage 2 and 3 evaluations AVR C++ was used.

## Tasks

This clock is basically a normal Alarm clock, and it can manage 7 different alarms with 5 different 
ringing tones. We can choose separate ringing tones for each alarm and it is based on your preference. 
There are 5 push buttons, which are UP, DOWN, SELECT, BACK and RESET. This alarm clock 
Energize with 9V battery and the RTC module operate with 3V internal battery

Features of the clock
- Set current time and date, month, year
- Set 7 alarms
- Choose a different alarm tone for each alarm out of 5 tones (Zelda's Lullaby, Green sleeves, 
 Cantina Band - Star Wars, Hedwig's theme from harry potter movies, Song of storms)
- View alarms and their status (on/off)
- Modify alarms after they were set (modify alarm time or alarm tone)
- Delete alarms
- Turn on/off LED backlight
- Reset all to the default status
